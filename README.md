# Singing-steppers
Arduino code that let's you play Sweden - C418 with up to three steppers motors simultaneously using tone.h library

The pins on arduino were programmed to work with a CNC shield V3, which can fit up to three stepper motors running at the same time. Steppers should be connected at X, Z, Y position

The library Tone.h enables the playing of up to three tones simultaneously at different outputs, t0, t1, t2 corresponds to the time it takes to play a single note within a 110bpm song.
